              <div class="timeline-body">
                <p>The midwife situation in Berlin is pretty complicated. The German health system allows you to be looked after by a midwife before, during and after the birth. However if you want to be sure to have one, you already have to start looking for one. Same goes in case you're already planning to give birth in a "Geburtshaus" - a place to give birth that isn't a hospital.</p>

                <p>If you prefer to give birth in a hospital, you should now have a look into the ones around you. Most offer "Infoabend" - a meeting where the hospital staff introduces itself and tells you more about the hospital policy and view on birth. Some hospitals like Westend even require future parents to register themselves as soon as possible, which is why it is advised to inquire from now on about hospitals to make sure to have all options still available.</p>

                <p>Midwives, Geburtshaus or hospitals offer prenatal classes for both parents. They are very useful to attend as a couple as they provide many tips and help for what comes before, during and after the birth.</p>

                <p>Berlin has a current lack of kindergarten spots, so you should start going on a hunt for one of them. Kindergartens are more commonly called "kitas" in Germany. Here is our <%= link_to 'kita', kindergartens_path %> page to help you find the one that fits you best.</p>
                <p>Once your baby will be born, you will need to visit the pediatrician. You can already call the pediatricians around you to see if they still take new patients.</p>
                <p>Finally for this month, if you and your partner aren't married, the father will have to ackknowledge fatherhood (Vaterschaftanerkennung) and the mother will have to grant him rights over the child (Sorgerecht). Since it requires both parents to go to the Jugendamt, it does make sense to do both before the birth.</p>

                <p>This month is the paperwork month! Firstly, the mother should warn her health insurance that she will soon enter maternity leave. Your gynecologist will deliver you an official piece of paper that states the due date. It should be sent to your health insurance about 8 weeks before said due date.</p>
                <p>Because you won't have so much time to deal with it once your baby is there, discuss with your partner about parental leave (Elternzeit in German) and start filling the different forms.</p>

                <p>The birth of your baby is getting closer and closer! If you're delivering your baby at the hospital, do not forget to pack a bag of all the things you will need during your stay there. Moreover some hospitals offer the possibility to declare the birth of your child directly on their premises, so don't forget to pack as well all the documents that are necessary.</p>

                <p>These are the very last moments before your baby arrives. If you still have enough time and energy, you can wash your baby clothes in case they are new. What's a nice add is to actually cook some meals that you will freeze: the first days back home can prove rather stressful, and having tasty homemade meals that just need to be rewarmed can be a real life-saver!</p>
